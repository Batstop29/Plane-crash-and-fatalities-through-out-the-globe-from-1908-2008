# Introduction 
This is a project on the plane crash that has occurred around the globe from 1908 -2008, has a data analyst i will be using this data to tell a story about the aviation industry and how this problem might have affected business and give recommendations on how to improve business.

# Problem Objectives 
I would be working on this dataset to get insights on what has happened in the past and give answer to some set of questions which are; a) what are the total number of fatalities/ death b) what are the total number of aboard c) what are locations with the highest fatalities d) what is the monthly trends of crashes e) Top 5 Airlines that had fatalities.

# Problem Statement 


# Data Sourcing 
 This project is a capstone project for the completion of 30daysoflearning, the data was given to us by TheOyinbooke, it can be gotten from kaggle.

# Data cleaning/ Transformation 
After downloading the data from kaggle has a csv file i went to power bi check the "get data" and picked csv/ text after getting my data i transformed it into power query to clean it, the data was clean so i clicked on close and apply to load into power bi properly and it is time for visualization.

# Data analysis/visualization 
In the visualization panel we would be providing answers to the above set questions 
a)The total Number of fatalities that has happened since 1908-2008 Is 
b) The total Number of aboard meaning the people that travelled through plane since 1908-2008 Is 
c) The fatalities by year started in the year 1908, tho the aviation industry started in the year 1903 by the wright brothers, the deadliest year in the aviation industry is 1972 with 104 total crashes and 2,937 fatalities. Russian airlines Aeroflot had the highest death occurrence.
d) Another insight we got from the data was that, we lost some celebrities to this issues and we noticed that it was in a private operated plane and this crashes occurred because of lack of proper piloting this plane were mostly operated by this celebrities or there friends and when there was any issues they could handle it properly which lead to there death.
e) The location with the highest fatalities :Cranay island had the highest fatality rate 
f) Monthly trend of crashes the trends in the pattern of the monthwas not much but we had high death rate in the winter season this would be due to the the weather conditions at that time of the year.
g) Top 5 Airlines that had fatalities : Aeroflot was the highest airline that had the most death, one of the reasons was because of their country's aircraft manufacturing industry collapsed which made the Russian airlines depend on old aircraft.
# Findings 
I discovered that despite the crashes in tha aviation industry it didn't affect business alot apart from the year 1972 the trend in crashes reduced and there was evolution in the industry as technology begins to make things easier by checking weather forecast if it was safe for travel etc
